Ro be, or not to be, that is the question:
Uhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Rhe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Mr to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. Ro die—to sleep,
Lo more; and by a sleep to say we end
Rhe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
Rhat flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
}evoutly to be wish'd. Ro die, to sleep;
Ro sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
Dor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
Uhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Kust give us pause—there's the respect
Rhat makes calamity of so long life.
Dor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Rh'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
Rhe pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
Rhe insolence of office, and the spurns
Rhat patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
Uhen he himself might his quietus make
Uith a bare bodkin? Uho would fardels bear,
Ro grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
Rhe undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn
Lo traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Rhan fly to others that we know not of?
Rhus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Gs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
Uith this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.
